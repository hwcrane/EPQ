# Introduction

While learning about algorithms in both my Computer Science and Further Maths studies, I found that watching a visualisation of the algorithms makes them much easier to understand. However, I simultaneously found that it was not easy to find something that visualises the algorithms in an easy way to follow. That is why I decided to create my own. Therefore, throughout this project, I will create an educational tool that visualises and explains sorting, searching and pathfinding algorithms.

I have decided to develop the tool as a web application so that it is easy to access and use. I intend that the application will be able to assist future students in learning about the different algorithms. Due to the use case being educational, my application will need a clean, intuitive and visually appealing user interface. This is because suppose the application is not easy to use. In that case, it will turn off people trying to learn from it, thereby failing as an educational tool.
The algorithms I will be visualising are as follows:

-   Sorting

    -   Bubble Sort
    -   Quick Sort
    -   Insertion Sort
    -   Merge Sort
    -   Selection Sort
    -   Heap Sort
    -   Radix Sort
    -   Bucket Sort

-   Searching

    -   Linear Search
    -   Binary Search
    -   Jump Search
    -   Exponential
    -   Fibonacci

-   Pathfinding

    -   Dykstra's
    -   A\*
    -   Breadth-First
    -   Best-First

This project will be structured into three sections, with one for each type of algorithms. Each section will then be split into subsections for each algorithm and one for designing the page for that algorithm. For each algorithm subsection, I will first need to research the algorithm to understand how it works. I will explain how it works, provide pseudocode for it, and provide my implementation of the algorithm. I will then use my explanation and implementation in the application.
